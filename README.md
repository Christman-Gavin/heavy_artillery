## Overview

Heavy Artillery is a powerful Rust crate designed for blazingly-fast panics. It provides an efficient implementation of the panic! macro. Whether you're working on scientific simulations, machine learning models, or any other computationally intensive applications, Heavy Artillery equips you with the tool required to panic for no good reason.

## Features

- **heavy_artillery**: A custom made function to make your code panic as if it was under fire by heavy artillery.

## Getting Started

To use Heavy Artillery in your Rust project, simply add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
heavy_artillery = "0.1.0"
```

And call it like so:

```rust
fn main() {
    heavy_artillery();
}

```

And then YOU too, can panic in style.
